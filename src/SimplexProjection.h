/*
 * Perform simplex projection prediction using state-space reconstruction.
 *
 * Given reconstructed state-space vectors and corresponding target values,
 * this function predicts target values at specified prediction indices by
 * weighting nearest neighbors from a given library set.
 *
 * Distance calculations exclude NaN components to ensure numerical stability.
 * Supports two distance metrics and optional averaging of distance by the
 * number of valid vector components.
 *
 * Supported distance metrics:
 *   dist_metric = 1: L1 (Manhattan) distance
 *   dist_metric = 2: L2 (Euclidean) distance
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   vectors        - A 2D vector representing reconstructed state-space vectors.
 *                    Each element vectors[i] is a vector/state at time i.
 *   target         - The time series values corresponding to each vector.
 *   lib_indices    - Indices specifying which states to use as library (neighbors).
 *   pred_indices   - Indices specifying which states to make predictions for.
 *   num_neighbors  - Number of nearest neighbors considered for prediction. Default is 4.
 *   dist_metric    - Distance metric selector (1: Manhattan, 2: Euclidean). Default is 2 (Euclidean).
 *   dist_average   - Whether to average distance by the number of valid vector components. Default is true.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A vector<double> of predicted target values aligned with input target size.
 *   Entries are NaN if prediction is not possible for that index.
